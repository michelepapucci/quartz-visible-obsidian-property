# Quartz v4

Quartz is a set of tools that helps you publish your [digital garden](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) and notes as a website for free.
Quartz v4 features a from-the-ground rewrite focusing on end-user extensibility and ease-of-use.

This is a Fork of the original Quartz repository showcasing a custom component called Properties. 
This is a fan project, I have no association with either Obsidian's nor Quartz's dev team. 

Most of the code comes from [another user](https://github.com/natashayasi/quartz/commit/d42e0bcab0b234498a5e746b38dd6f903486babc) work for a simiar functionality that I simply perfected to my own taste. 

A live demo of the Obsidian Properties shown in a Quartz pages can be found [here](https://michelepapucci.github.io/quartz-visible-obsidian-property/) with a little tutorial on how to install the component.
